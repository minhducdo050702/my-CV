**VITON - Virtual Tryon**

Virtual try-on is a narrow research branch of the Generative Adversarial Network and Diffusion Model. However, in order to perform the Virtual try-on problem, there are other subproblems that need to be worked on, such as image segmentation or pose estimation, and many more subproblems.

**Differential Privacy DL Optimizers Research**

Right now, i am researching about the intersection lines between DP and DL.

**Quantum Neural Network**


- Built a small QNN library that includes classes such as Feedforward, CNN, and LSTM. Researched important formulas for training networks, including gradient calculations (using the shift parameter rule for derivatives in quantum computing).
- Network structures are similar to classical neural networks, and the classes can be combined with classical networks to form hybrid networks. Used a simulator for testing due to lack of access to a quantum computer, resulting in good outcomes due to the absence of noise.
- Applied Transfer Learning in QNN to classify MNIST images, using methods similar to classical approaches.
- Proposed the Quantum Quantization Aware Training (QQAT) method to enhance the efficiency of QNNs on resource-constrained devices.

**MageCode - a code analysis system for the Bach Khoa Cyber Security Center**



- Project submitted for the Student Research Conference. Consists of three modules: analyzing whether the code was written by a human or machine, checking for code plagiarism if written by a human, and checking for logical errors such as array overflows and division by zero.
- Responsible for the third module, using LLM for error checking and CodeQL from GitHub for static analysis.
- Project is still under development at the 405th floor of the Institute of Information and Communication Technology to become a full product.
- Served as the PM, proposed the idea (with support from professors), managed the team, and designed the main workflows (determining which module the source code should enter first, which tools to use for analysis, how to conduct checks, and identifying the target audience for the product).
